  Board -- Testing is-occupied
    ✓ no cell at [-1, 5] is not a valid cell
    ✓ 2 is E of blue1 and is thus unoccupied
    ✓ [3, white2] is SE of blue2

  Board -- Testing build
    ✓ no cell at [-1, 5] so cant build

  Board -- Testing move
    ✓ no cell at [-1, 5] so cant move
    ✓ blue1 can move SE to [1, 1]
    ✓ white1 can move W to [0, 3] where height is 2
    ✓ white2 can move W because 0 < 4

  Player -- Testing Placement of Workers
    ✓ empty board, so place at top two corners

  RuleChecker -- Testing Invalid Move, Any Build
    ✓ blue2 cant move SE even though building W after is valid -- invalid
    ✓ blue1 cant move S -- invalid
    ✓ blue1 cant move N because its outside of the boardInstance -- invalid

  RuleChecker -- Testing Valid Move, Valid Build
    ✓ blue1 moves SE and build N to 4 -- valid
